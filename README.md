### 🌟 About the Game

**Memory Blocks Game** is not your average memory flip game. It's a **fully interactive, category-based memory challenge** that tests how sharp your brain is — under pressure!

Whether you're into **Animals**, **Fruits**, **Programming**, **Countries**, or even **Social Media**, there's a category for everyone. But beware — each category comes with its own **time limit** and difficulty level. Can you beat the clock and climb the leaderboard?

### 🌟 Key Features

✅ **9 Unique Categories**
🐾 Animals, 🧑‍💻 Programming, 🌍 Countries, 🛠 Tools, 🏀 Sports, 🍎 Fruits, 🥦 Vegetables, 😃 Emojis, and more in the future!

🕒 **Category-Based Countdown Timer**
Every category has a different time limit based on difficulty — adding excitement and variety to every round.

🎮 **Real-Time Leaderboard**
Your score, tries, category, and time left are saved and displayed beautifully. Compete with yourself and others locally (saved in LocalStorage).

💬 **Multilingual Instructions**
Supports **English 🇬🇧** and **Arabic 🇪🇬** for the *How to Play* section.  
Players can choose their preferred language before reading the rules.

⚡ **Smooth Animations & Transitions**
Thanks to **Animate.css**, every action feels responsive and alive — from opening modals to matching cards.

🔊 **Sound Effects**
Custom sound effects for actions: clicking, matching, failing, timeout, and celebration.

🎨 **Stunning UI with Gradients and Shadows**
Modern, responsive, and mobile-friendly layout using **pure CSS**, with gradient backgrounds and glassmorphism-style UI.

🧠 **Smart Memory Logic**

* Two-block flip system
