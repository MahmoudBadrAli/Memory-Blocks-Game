### 🌟 About the Game

**Memory Blocks Game** is not your average memory flip game. It's a **fully interactive, category-based memory challenge** that tests how sharp your brain is — under pressure!

Whether you're into **Animals**, **Fruits**, **Programming**, **Countries**, or even **Social Media**, there's a category for everyone. But beware — each category comes with its own **time limit** and difficulty level. Can you beat the clock and climb the leaderboard?
